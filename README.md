# Spine Atlas Cloner

A tool for auto-duplicating and renaming Spine `.atlas` files to match each exported `.json` file automatically, removing the need for manual duplication and renaming when dealing with dozens of exported Spine files.

## Features
- Automatically duplicates a combined `.atlas` file for each `.json` file exported from Spine
- Renames `.atlas` files to match corresponding `.json` file names
- Optionally edits the `.atlas` file to point to the correct texture image if you have renamed it
